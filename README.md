Problem Statement
Utilizes AI to predict accident severity or occurrence using features like weather, lighting, and road type to aid in proactive safety measures.

Objectives
Predict accident severity

Identify key contributing factors

Enable data-driven road safety decisions

Ensure model usability and accuracy

Dataset
Source: UK Road Safety Data (Kaggle)

Size: 1.5M+ records, 30+ features

Target: Accident Severity (1=Fatal, 2=Serious, 3=Slight)

Process Workflow
Data Acquisition → Preprocessing → EDA → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Interpretation → Reporting

Key Techniques
Preprocessing: Merging, handling missing values, encoding, normalization

EDA: Identified severity patterns and contributing factors

Feature Engineering: Time extraction, interaction terms, PCA

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, SHAP values

Insights
Darkness and poor weather increase severity

Dual carriageways are generally safer

XGBoost achieved ~0.88 AUC
